# Decision Maker

This app is written in HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery.

It can help a user make decisions.

It can use its own "go to" list of restaurants, and you can add choices to that list.

Alternatively, you can create a list of your own to choose from.

You can visit the live version of the app [here](https://rcaseyx.github.io/decision-maker/).
